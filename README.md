2.	How many hours do you estimate you used completing this assignment?
I spent about 5 hours on this assignment
3.	What was easiest for you when completing this assignment?
The easiest part for me was the programming logic. I knew pretty much from the beginning what I wanted to do and how I wanted to do it.
4.	The most difficult challenge was the JavaScript – I am not very familiar with JavaScript code and parts of it doesn’t make much sense, in my opinion. I hope I get a chance to work more with JavaScript and become more proficient with the language. I also spent quite some time on formatting my output to look at least decent in the html file. I fought with \n (for newline) which I could not get to work. I couldn’t get <br> to work either, so I ended up switching tactics and formatted using tabs, <p> and <pre> instead.
